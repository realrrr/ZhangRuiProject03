Thank you very much for purchasing or updating the new Bar Interior Exterior Kit formally known as the Wine Liquor Beer Glassware and Modular Bar Build Kit

If you already own the package or are purchasing it brand new, I would greatly appreciate it if you could take a minute to rate and review my package.

Your feedback encourages me to create new and bigger packages.

Go to the Scenes folder to see all the structures, a total of 6.

The Build Kit is made based off a grid system X, Z, Y  Walls & Floors of 2.5 X 2.5 X 4, you can use Unity’s progrids to assist building located in the Unity’s Package Manager.

The Interior walls sit on top of the interior floors in order to have a nice seamless fit.

A number of brand new textures, brand new and revised materials, optimized models and a vast amount of brand new models and artwork have been added.

I cannot show you my appreciation enough.   I hope you enjoy using these assets as much as I enjoyed producing them.

With Many Thanks!
